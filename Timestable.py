# 1. Give a guess what you think this code is going to do before you run it.
#Answer:
#This code is designed to generate and display the multiplication (times) table for a given number. 
#It asks the user to input a number and then prints the multiplication table from 1 to 12.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))   #2. What do you think this line is going to do?
#Answer:
#This line prompts the user to enter a number.
#The input is initially a string, but int() converts it into an integer so it can be used for mathematical operations.
#If a user enters a non-numeric value, the program will crash with a ValueError
#If a user enters a non-numeric value, the program will crash with a ValueError

print(f"\nTimes Table for {num}:\n")    #3. There is an error on this line can you find it and fix it?
#Answer:
#The error is that there is an unclosed string and a comment inside the f-string.
#The #3. part should be a comment outside the string.
   
for i in range(1, 13):                 #4. Any guess as to what this strange line is supposed to do?
#Answer:
#This line creates a loop that runs from 1 to 12 (inclusive).
#It iterates over numbers 1 to 12, meaning it will run 12 times.
#It is meant to generate the multiplication table.
    print(f"{num} × {i} = {num * i}")  #5. There's an error here too. Try to fix it.
#Answer:
#Inside the f-string, {num} × {i} is correct, but "num * i" is treated as plain text.
#It should be {num * i} to perform the multiplication.
